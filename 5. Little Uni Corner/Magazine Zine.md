  What if i told you, you don’t need to have fun in a video game to enjoy it? 


I think if you ask anyone on what the main goal of a game is, it is to affect the player in a certain way, with the most commmon being of course fun. 

Videogames are a quite unique medium that is evolving more and more as time goes by. The difference between a piece of art and a game has practically becull null and void in this day and age, with there being a broad understanding that this medium can affect us in many many ways. They can cause, happiness, sadness, fear… even love. But still… the expextations of videogames is that they are ”fun”; that they welcome you to play with open arms and let you into their worlds.

But what of games that do the exact opposite? Games that would rather grab you by the back of your neck and push it in a pot of boiling water than to even suggest holding your hand. Games that punish you over and over again for not understanding mechanics they did not explain… games so unfun, they managed to loop right back around into enjoyable.

Games, like fear and hunger:


What is fear and hunger:

Fear and hunger, and its successor, fear and hunger: termina, are both 2D, turn based rpgs that exists to punish you for opening the game. The mechanics are hard to understand, you have to manage multiple finite recouces while you fight enemies that are likely to kill you in two or three turns; you get permanent debuff and even saving is decided on a 50/50 cointoss. 

Surely, after entering the dungeon, starving and eating dirt in order to fight of hunger, loosing both your arms to hulking behemoth of an enemy that i cannot fully show or descibe here And utterly lost in the maze like structure of this dungeon, one would never want to enter the dungeon again. But i did.

Hopefully through the discussion of some of my anecdotes you will learn what draws me and many more to games like this.


Fun factors
One of the core drives that had me coming back to this game was acctually its hostility to the player. The game… felt sort of like it was taunting the player. It felt like my own Momy dick i had to contour.

Fightiring against a game that hates you, for example:

Motivated for near impossibility discussed how, as the name suggest, Herculean tasks can become a source of for a person. While the task itself,( and in this game playing the game) is not fun in itself, the idea of having overcome something that you deem near impossible drives you until you finally achieve your goal and are met with greater enjoyment than if you had done an easier, maybe funnier task. 

Hard games also present a feeling not too disimilar  to spice. They are a bit of an aqured taste that come with a mouthful of pain on initial bite and even hours after, but the resulting feeling is a satisfaction that is hard to put into words.

The pleasure of learning and self improvment is also major driving force in enjoying hard videogames. the act of understanding the in and outs of a game is a massive sorce of satifaction, especially when one started out without nowing a single thing. 

Dying and learning in fear and hunger
“If players are motivated to play video games because they have the poten- tial to insulate them from subconscious thoughts about their own death, then why would anyone play roguelikes? Furthermore, who would dedicate their free time to creating games that kill their players in increasingly convoluted and occulted ways?” P127

Touglelike present an infinite train and error area. Infinate gameplay that does not change. hpever acroding to this paper, what makes permadeath in these games bearable is that there is comfort knowing that you are not making real progress and isn’t sad going for a loop. There Is also no ceremony to the deaths, they are quick and instantly take you to the opening screan where you hear the familiar music.

Fear and hunger though has a the concept of permadeath while still having a robust ongoing story. Death eventually stops becoming a punishment.
Companions also prema die burying another player of stress.

The disorientating new world

We get to experiencing the feelings of shame and anger in small doses. P134 videogames can allow us to experience failure without major repucussions. Letting go of your fear of failure,

Not only the feeling of overcoming failure can be enjoyable, but failure itself can be too.

This was more of a personal experience but i found the game extremely funny. Maybe because the game was full of sudden death and adversity - and a major part of humor is surprise, but also because fo the “mechanical inelasticity”p147 as I stumbled like a fool and kept stumbling due to my own lack of kowlage.
