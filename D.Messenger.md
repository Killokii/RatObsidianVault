Messenger Introduction
--- 
=== 

Istota: As you walk up to the figures, none of them respond to you in the slightest.

Istota: While they do not respond to you, you are taken quite aback by their presence.

	//One of them is standing in a puddle of blood before a corpse, looking at the half-torso with its empty sockets. It does not even give you a glance, holding out a letter canister toward the floor. If you didn’t know what it was, you might have wondered if it was even alive.
	

Patyczek: An undead with a letter in its palm... It must be a messenger... what is it doing here?

Istota: No clear answers came to mind, but did it even matter?

Patyczek: it did not.

Istota: then you should stop focusing on the messengers and continue your looting.

	// Then you notice the other two nearby—one crouched beside the remains of a broken carriage, carefully collecting scattered scraps of parchment, and the third perched unnervingly still on a jagged rock, head tilted at an impossible angle. All three of them held identical canisters.

Istota: They Ignore you. Its not like you are interested in talking with them either.

	//(Look around site first)











Istota: Then it clicked—was the corpse under the first one supposed to be the recipient of the letter? But if so, the Messenger should have left and tried to deliver it to the corpse’s closest kin, or back to the sender.

Istota: No matter. Not your problem.

Istota: However, just as you were about to turn and leave, the first Messenger turned to you, shoving the letter into your chest. (You physically try to leave)

Patyczek: "What are you doing?"

Messenger holding the letter: ".... Eel.... person.... deliver... to Eel.... warning..."

Patyczek: !!!

Istota: Eel?? This letter was supposed to be delivered to the Eel merchants? With such a sudden revelation, you finally look around and see the half-destroyed insignias of the Eel on the remnants of the carriage and the corpses... well, rather, of your dead colleagues.
(Pan camera to show insignias)

Istota: With no more hesitation, you took the letter and read it, putting your forehead into your palm as you digested all the information inside. (You have to read the letter Yourself )

Istota: The gist of it took all color out of your face… as it insinuated that these colleagues of yours not only had the gall to covet what they were tasked to deliver, but were also idiotic enough to bring it to such a dangerous area and die. Some people truly exist for the pure purpose of giving you a migraine. 

Istota: Thank the Eel you were casually making your way through here in between requests. It was not too late to fix the situation. You take out a paper, writing briefly before placing your seal onto the page.

Patyczek: "You. Big one. Take this. Go to your master and say that I, Assistant Manager of the Morana branch of the Order of the Eel, will be overtaking this request. As for you two... where is the item?"

Messenger: "Where is...? Where... item... umm... lost... not know... where..."

Istota: You resist the urge to kick the corpse below your feet. Thankfully, the small Messenger took out a small compass-like object from its clothing.

Messenger: "I... track... item... can... track..."

Istota: Thank goodness.

Patyczek: "Alright, let us not waste any more time then. Let’s go fetch it."
