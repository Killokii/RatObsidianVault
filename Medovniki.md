this is the recipe for honestly my favorite cookie, the medovniki aka the honey cookies. They are an offshoot of the medovnik cake and are very similar to make. The only difference is the fact that these cookies are spiced opposed its more plain counterpart.

These cookies result in crunchy, not overly sweet shapes of goodness that are wonderful to eat! And because of their high structural integrity, they can probably be used as decor: I totally see a gingerbread house being made out of them.

Anyway, letâ€™s get onto the recepie. To make them, you will need the following:


Here are the instructions:
1. First go all, mix all your dry ingredients together and put them to the side.
2. Place your butter, sugar and honey in a saucepan on medium heat. Cook until the sugar has completely melted and the mixture starts lightly bubbling.
3. Once that is done, remove from the heat and let it cool for a second.
4. Making sure that the mixture is still very warm but not hot enough to seer the eggs, pour the eggs in slowly while mixing vigorously.
5. After everything is well mixed, add in the dry ingreadients and mix with a spatula.
6. Once everything looks fully incorporated, place the dough into the fridge and allow it to cool for a few hours. If you try working with it now, it will be way to sticky and become a huge mess.
7. Making sure the dough is workable, roll it out and bake it at 180 for 8 mins.
