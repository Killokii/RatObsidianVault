Corpse below the messengers feet
---

Istota: As you squat down to the corpse below the messengers feet, an odd feeling overtakes you as you look at its clothing. it looked familliar, earily familar. and not only that... 

patyczek: the uniform was made out of fish skin. it was thick, filled with the past imprints of scales and the distinct smell of water.

Carriage ruins
---

Istota: you go to the carrige, hoping to find something to loot.
istota: sadly all that is here is hardly salvagable, its all just corpses, food and ordinary trinkets that would not sell for more than the living expenses it would take to drag them to the closest vendor who would by them.

patyczek: and there...

istota: you focus on the half destoyed insignia on the side of the carrige.

Istota: its... a insignia of the eel.

Rubble

Istota:  you theorize what destoryed the carrige... was it a beast? defnetly seems like it with how the carrige was torn apart, and with the talon marks.
