Leaving the Astral plane



[[Eligor Lua]] was raised in the expanses of the astral plane, living a humble existence in his clan.  He was trained to be the guardian of the clan chieftain, with his parents teaching him the art of Astral puppetry, but [[Eligor Lua]] himself never wanted that role. In fact, he wanted to leave the astral plane all together. He felt that there was more out there in the world for him, more to see and more to explore. He did not want to be stuck next to the chieftain forever. There was very little he could do anything about his fate through, afterall his clan of elves were ones who hardly felt their villages, let alone the astal plane.

He surely would be stuck here forever — is what he thought.

On the night he was supposed to pick up appointment as the next chief guardian, he had an unexpected encounter. 

While preparing himself, a purple flame appeared in the middle of his room. This flame did not spread or emit heat. It only softly burned in the center of his room. [[Eligor Lua]] did not know what internal demon he was compelled by, but he felt attracted to that flame. It felt like this flame, although it had not uttered a word and even alcked a body, understood him in some way. His deep hunger for the outside world and new experiences was reflected in his eyes through this flame.

That was when Eligor stuck his hands into those flames. Pain immedely hit him like a truck as the purple flame seared his hands. It was as if it was digesting them. Hideous scares formed on his hand. The pain was so strong that Eligor passed out from the shock.

When he woke up, he was no longer in the astral plane. He was not alone either, as he woke up to a skinny alibno imp sitting on his chest, staring at him with its beady red eyes. Eligor, without having to be told, knew insitnctably what he had done.

He had formed some sort of pact with some goody being, a being he did not know the name of. He stirred to ask the imp what deity this was, but the deity did not tell him. 

Elligor was confused and quite concerned to be honest. But his hands, who were deeply scarred did not even sting a bit anymore, and ultimately, he got his wish to be in the human world. This seamed like a positive outcome for himself so he through he might as well take advantage of it.

It took a little work, but he somehow found a job in the human realm as a chef. His boss was a kind stranger who saw him experimenting in the forest with cooking and decided to teach him. He spent a good while at the restorant, that was until some cloaked figures showed up at his doorstep. They claimed to be part of the cult of hadar, and said he is the hadars chosen.







In fact, he simply wanted to leave the astral 






In the ethereal expanse of the Astral Plane, where time and space weave a tapestry beyond mortal comprehension, lived an elf named Eligor. Born to a clan of astral elves, Eligor was a curious fellow that grew bored of the astral sea, instead drawn to the mysteries beyond his home realm. While his kin were content with their astral existences, Eligor seeked more out of life. as such, as soon as opportunity stuck, he snuck out and made an extraordinary journey across the planes.

Discoveries in the martial plane and friendship

Upon stepping foot onto the Material Plane, Eligor was immediately captivated by the myriad sensations and experiences that it offered. Amidst his explorations, he stumbled upon an unexpected passion: cooking. The art of creating flavors, blending ingredients, and crafting exquisite dishes became a form of meditation for him, a way to bridge the gap between his astral nature and the tangible world.

Betrayal and The Violet Hunger

However, his newfound sense of purpose was abruptly shattered when he fell victim to a group of worshippers who were captivated by his exotic origins. They exposited his trust, capturing the rather meek and gullible Eligor without much trouble. Once he was in the palm of their hands, the worshippers used him as a sacrifice for their deity, Hadar, hoping to fall into his good graces by giving him such a rare feast. Through the pain and betrayal, Eligor's faith in humanity crumbled, and a festering darkness crept into his heart. Just as he was about to bleed out on the sacrificial altar however, a unexpected thing happened. the worshippers were consumed in Hadars flames, eaten alive by the one they revered. But, the flames did not target him, intead they suggestivley floated around Eligor, tempting him. Seeing an opportunity, Eligor sat up and reached into the flames, Marking himsleff with Hadars wrath as a pact formed between them.

Fulfillment of Pact

In the grip of Hadar's dark power, Eligor became an instrument of destruction, a conduit for the terrible might of the Void. Loyal to his sinister patron, he unleashed a nightmarish torrent of shadows and despair upon a once-thriving town that lay nestled among rolling hills. With an eerie calm, he summoned tendrils of inky blackness that reached out hungrily, wrapping around buildings and homes like vipers seeking prey.

The town's serene existence was shattered as chaos erupted. The sun's warm light was snuffed out by the suffocating darkness conjured by Eligor's twisted connection to Hadar. Buildings crackled and groaned as the shadows consumed them, reducing them to smoldering ruins. Flames danced amidst the darkness, casting an eerie, ghostly glow on the destruction wrought by Eligor's malevolent power.

As the flames consumed everything in their path, the once-vibrant streets turned into a scene of devastation. Innocent lives were lost, families torn apart, and the air itself was tainted with an unsettling sense of dread. In his newfound form, Eligor watched with an unsettling detachment, fueled by Hadar's influence, as the town burned around him.

But then, as the last embers flickered and darkness waned, a moment of clarity broke through Eligor's haze. Amidst the ruins, he saw the faces of the people he had unwittingly harmed – the innocent, the young, and the helpless. Regret, a torrential wave of guilt, crashed over him. The power that once seemed intoxicatingly seductive now bore the weight of his atrocities.

In that somber moment, he made a fateful decision. The shadows around him recoiled as he severed his connection to Hadar, the pact that had once given him unimaginable power. The darkness lifted, leaving Eligor standing amidst the ruins of the town, stripped of his borrowed strength and feeling more powerless than he had ever been.

Haunted by the faces of those he had hurt, Eligor vowed to spend the rest of his days seeking redemption for his terrible deeds. No longer bound by the malevolent force that had once controlled him, he walked the streets as a broken man, his steps heavy with remorse and regret. He yearned to find a way to heal the wounds he had inflicted upon the innocent, to make amends for the darkness he had allowed to consume him.

Disillusionment and hope

The next few weeks, Eligor wandered the streets, a hollow shelf of himslef. He could not even feed himself as his hands were too injured to hold a spoon, and in these lands no one would give out their generosity to a mere beggar. And returning to his home was impossible at this point, he had no idea how let alone have the power to do so.

In the weeks that followed, Eligor wandered as a mere shadow of his former self. His hands, injured and weak, could no longer hold a spoon to feed himself. A beggar in a land where generosity was scarce, he had no way to return to his former life, lost within the tangled web of his circumstances.

Just as despair threatened to swallow him whole, a glimmer of hope emerged in the form of a cloaked man – Disious. With a simple bowl of soup, the cloaked figure extended not just sustenance, but a lifeline. The gesture reignited Eligor's purpose, rekindling his passion for cooking and his desire to bring warmth and nourishment to others. With newfound loyalty to Disious and the burgeoning Cult of the Meek, Eligor became a stalwart ally, recruiting members and crafting meals that embodied the organization's ideology.

Kind-hearted and caring toward his newfound comrades, Eligor's commitment to ensuring the well-being and happiness of those around him was unwavering. Yet, beneath the surface, the remnants of his malevolent past lingered, infusing his actions with ruthlessness and calculated intent. The lingering taint of his pact with Hadar colored his motivations, granting his deeds an unsettling blend of compassion and darkness.

Renewed loyalty and resolve

With each passing day, Eligor found himself enmeshed in the operations of the Cult of the Meek. His culinary talents became a cornerstone of the organization's efforts to provide comfort to the downtrodden and the marginalized. The aroma of his cooking drew people to the Cult's safe havens, where they were greeted not only with nourishment but also a sense of belonging and community.

As he honed his cooking skills to serve a greater purpose, Eligor also developed an uncanny ability to discern the needs of those around him. He could sense the hunger in their eyes, not just for food, but for compassion, understanding, and hope. This unique insight further cemented his role within the Cult as a symbol of redemption, bridging the gap between his past malevolence and his newfound commitment to healing.

Yet, the darkness that had once consumed him remained an ever-present undercurrent. It whispered to him in the quiet moments, tempting him with the power he had once wielded. The malice that had marked his actions lingered in his mind, reminding him of the atrocities he had committed. At times, he felt like a haunted man, striving to make amends while grappling with his own inner demons.

Eligor's relationship with Disious was complex. The cloaked figure was both mentor and confidant, guiding him on the path of the Cult's benevolent mission. Disious saw the potential for redemption within Eligor and recognized the genuine remorse that plagued him. Their interactions were marked by discussions about the balance between darkness and light, the possibility of transformation, and the responsibility that came with power.

Upon stepping foot onto the Material Plane, Eligor was immediately captivated by the myriad sensations and experiences that it offered. Amidst his explorations, he stumbled upon an unexpected passion: cooking. The art of creating flavors, blending ingredients, and crafting exquisite dishes became a form of meditation for him, a way to bridge the gap between his astral nature and the tangible world.
