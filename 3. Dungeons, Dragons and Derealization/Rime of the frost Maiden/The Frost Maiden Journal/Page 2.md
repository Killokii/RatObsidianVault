the SLED quest complete!
- We learned that [[Duvvessa Shane]] is the town speaker of[[Bryn Shander]]
- once we returned to the town, we handed off the iron to the [[Black iron blade]] smithy.
	At the smithy, we bought a few items and made a deal with the [[Madame of the black blade]] for a joint venture. Not only have we made an allegiance with the black blades, but we also made an order:
	- a Large pot
	- a Sled to hold that pot
	- a Number of Meek Insignia

Poster Order  
    We ordered 50 order of the meek posters from [[A resident Artist]]

In the city we also heard of a number of rumors while at the local tavern:
- [[Ouriel the Frost maiden]] might be located on an island in the [[Moving Sea of ice]]
- There is a [[Mysterious whale]] with a house on it somewhere.
- people have spotted mysterious figures around the towns, with them potentially being the [[frost druids]]
- In [[Targos]], there is a [[eager band of adventurers]] planning an outing to [[Kelvins Cairn]], hoping to find [[Oyaminatok]], the Goliath lycanthrope who can transform into a polarbear.

Another person of interest we met in the city was a half elf-called [[Danika Greysteel]], a researcher Investigating the climate of Tentowns. Her theory was that spirits called [[Chawinga]] are responsible for these extreme weather conditions and as such has tasked our party to find her some and bring it to her. She also gave us a lamp that glows every time one of these elementals is near:

    NEEDED: a living chawinga specimen (UNHARMED)

She said that [[Chawinga]] posses the following traits:
- they are tiny elementals that live among nature: plants, rivers, snow and the like.
- they are small and shy: easily spooked.
- due to their elemental origin, they are innate spell casters.
- they are very passive creatures
- they are quite agile.
