- We killed the yetis and collected their horns
	- at this point, all the members of the [[eager band of adventurers]] had perished. Thankfully, [[Gareth]] managed to survive.
		- The Goliath was killed by the yetis, and so was the gnome.
		- The Tiefling in the party froze to death, but we managed to loot her body and gain a spellbook
- on out way to [[Keagan]], we get attacked by a member of the [[frost druids]]. Thankfully we manage to defeat her.
- We order some horns to be carved in the name of the [[Order of the Meek]] from [[Keagan]]
	- We made him carve a yet horn which we got from them earlier as well as any other horns we had on us.
