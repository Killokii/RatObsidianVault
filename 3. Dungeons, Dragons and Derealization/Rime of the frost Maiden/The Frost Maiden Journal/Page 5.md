- following a request to kill a [[White Moose]], we head to [[Lonely Wood]]
- We then meet [[the old lady]], the town speaker of this town and she gives us more information on the location of this moose. She said it was last spotted deep in the woods and that she will give us 50gp if we deliver its head to her.
- While looking for the [[White Moose]], we encounter an [[Elven tomb]] covered in snow. It appears to have been abandoned for quite a while.

- This tomb had a few things of note:
	- A sarcophagus encased in crytal
	- A statue in the north of the structure
	- 6 elevated statues that depict robed elves who’s faces have been worn with time.
	- A large crystal in the center of the structure
	- And most importantly, moose tracks leading deeper into the [[Elven tomb]]

- We continued exploring the [[Elven tomb]].
	- on the side of this structure, we found a stone door with no handle.
	- in the middle of the circular thing is a moon dial
	- We found a hole to the side of the moon dial.
	- There is a gazebo to the side of the structure. It has a praiser inside.
	- There is a granite coffin surrounded by 5 crystal pillars engraved with (a twig, a pine cone, a feather, a flame, a hand). And a braiser I’d depicted on the coffin lid

 - After a bit of exploration, we decided to open the sarcophagus.
	 - Inside, there lay a mummy, who thanked us promptly for waking him.
	 - This mummy informed us that is was a sacrifice to the gods.
	 - When we asked for its name, it said that it had forgotten it long ago. As such, we decided to call him [[Sir Forgotten]].

- Satisfied with exploring the outside, we decided to head inside the tomb.
	- We were immediately greeted with a large amount of sleeping animals, one of which was the [[White Moose]]
- There are sleeping animals
- There is also the moose we where looking for
