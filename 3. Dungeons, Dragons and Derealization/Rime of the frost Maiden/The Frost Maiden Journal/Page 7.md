- Lord Dissius and The Githyanki fighter decided to torture the frost Druid.

- They put her in the coffin and tie her up.
- We asked her why she wants to destroy ten towns: she said that it doesn’t deserve to be here
- Who is Oriel: she is winters fury. She is a god. The people of ten towns do not worship her, they fear her.
- What does Orin give you: nothing, I serve her for being her.
- Where can you find them: they are scattered.
- What happened to her sister: she. Was outcasted and killed.

- We go and check out the scrying mirror.

- Our furry friend is the first one to scry. He tries to look for the man called benny

- From what we found, Benny appears to be in some sort of prison. There is a black armored man with a red scarf guarding outsiders

- Our with friend tries to scry from the gith called triken:

- We see from trikens perspective. He seems to be walking up to a rectangular castles embedded into a mountain.

- Next, is our resident gnasi searching for his sister, aveka vien

- He sees his sister collecting sticks and bundling them up. She attaches it to a backpack and seems to be wanting to bring them home. She is in a forest.

- My master scry’s oriel, the frost maiden

- He sees a an eyeball. The eyeball notices him.

- As we burried her in the coffin, she said the beats will come after us.

- The mirror shattered.
- We headed back to lonely wood

- While we where headning back, lord dyssius spotted an owl. Me and my lord attempted to shoot it down, however even when hit by both of our attacks it did not die.
- This owl was clearly not a normal owl and could be one of the beasts the Druid mentioned.

- We arrived at lonely wood

- We go to nibsley huddles home, and she welcomes us warmly

- We show her the moose head.
- She said that bremmin has an unusual sea monster possibly connected to the Druid.

- We headed to turmaline, then to targos. Then to bremmine
- We arrive at breimmine

- As we arrived at bremmine we meet a a dwarf that asks us to fish
- he says that his fishermen were supposed to be here an hour ago
- This fisherman’s name is Belldibor

- A half elf comes to up to us

- The half elf says that belldibor is sending us to your death as he knows about the beast and did not tell us.
- The elf is tali
- He is studying local wildlife
- He says that the sea creature has been here for a month but has really started to be violent a week ago
- There has been at least 5 casualties - fishermen
- He is not from icewindale
- he said that there was unusual water phenomenons
- He offers us a notebook to write down information about the creature

- after speaking to talk, we decide to go to the town speaker.

- We enter the town hall where a bunch of dwarves are agreeing.
- Dorbulgurf is the elf we speaking us
- The dwarves agree to pay us if we kill it and bring its body back.

- We go out into the water, and we hit a few ice sheets but we are overall fine.
- We go to clear water
- We found a fisherman from lonely wood but they headed back
- There is a boat from targos
- Our fuzzy friend also decided to fish.
- Our fuzzy friend managed to disturb the beast in the lake. It has a long neck and a serpentine appearance
- It speaks to us in common: “I’m listening”
