- the campaign has started!
- the tavern we stayed at was the [[Northlook inn]] which was located in the town of [[Bryn Shander]]
- The tavernkeeper was called [[Sarnix]]
- [[Eligor Lua]] and [[Disious]]  have met up with the rest of the party: [[SOPHAP]], [[Altesh]], [[KIKO]], [[Kree-Zu-Riath-KI]].

- [[Kree-Zu-Riath-KI]] was searching for [[The Missing Gith, Triken]].
- [[KIKO]] proclaimed himself as a gith knight.
- [[SOPHAP]] was searching for a were-polar bear named [[BENNY CABOOSE]] for unknown reasons.

- In this tavern we met the [[Dwarves in the Northlook inn]] who offered us a quest:

- SLED RECOVERY  
    Find the sled that belongs to the [[Black iron blade]] dwarves! they were delivering iron ingots in a mine located in [[Kelvins Cairn]]  and were attacked on the way.  
    REWARD: 50GP

- in this tavern we also learned about [[ Ouriel the Frost maiden]]
	- Apparently each town gives her sacrifices to appease here
	- she is said to be responsible for the lack of sun in icewindale, not even in the summer
	- she is also responsible for the current eternal winter
	- the aurora is her creation
	- due to her curse on this land, the people are isolated and dying.

 
 
 RECAP: This was when the party had come together in an unlikely circumstance after all of them decided to help the black iron blade dwarves. the party then decided to find the sled:

“We found a skeleton whose been dismembered. Around it, there are tracks that lead to the mine. The tracks are of sled origin: it is the iron sled that the dwarves request. The prints are goblin print that have been made within the last half an hour.

We found he goblins, there is six of them that are pulling the sled. They are pulling this sled towards a wagon that has two polar bears instead of horses. There are two more goblins at the wagon. The polar bears look unhappy.

Juniper saw that them having bows.

there was a confrontation and the party successfully took out the t goblins, after one member was downed. we then quickly chased down the wagon. the wagon turned out to be their makeshift”
