- e make it to caer-Dineval
- We notice a broken down watch tower, next to it there is a worn-down-shack.

- The watch tower obviously has been broken for a long time, probably hundreds of years ago
- We hear a voice in the worn-down-inn: dinner
- The voices are 6 duegar seeking shelter from the elements
- The duegar mention that there are new guards in caer-Dineval called the knights of the black sword

- These knights came here to beef up protection
- The knights came to help the town speaker but the town speaker has not been seen in a while
- It is highly likely that the town speaker is dead

- We go to the inn/tavern called the Up-hill-climb

- It was full so we decide to find another place to stay

- We managed to get into the castle.

- We find kennels, and among them there is a boy in a cage

- The boy says he is taking care of the dogs
- He’s been caged because he tried to steel some food
- He mentions that there are big cats around the area
- He is not locked, he is free to wonder
- He has been here around a month
- His name Alisar sulmander
- There are 3 Tiefling in the knights

- We get let to one of the towers

- I have Ramsey scout at the castle.

- There is a large area north of the castle
- On the first floor there is a dining area with two enclosed rooms to the left and right
- North of the dining area there are stairs with two enclosed tooms
- South of the castle there is an armory

- There is a red Tiefling guard in the armory
- The person who lead us is also guarding the armory

- Ramsey also notices that most the guards are fairly inexperienced- normal
- There are no old guard

- In the morning alisar comes to clean up our bedrolls

- He said Caroth sent him
- Caroth is the leader of the knights

- Kikou asks the knights about their necklaces

- The knight say it’s just something to unify them
- The knights say the serve a higher being: this is similar to a patron being.
- The magic power in the necklaces faded.
- This necklace can bring someone back to life.
- The necklace is possibly of devil origin

- The man who we are looking for is the man who led us to our sleeping quarters, his name is halwar
- We speak to carloth

- He mentioned that the town speaker is sick: he is lying through his teeth
- He decides to lead us to the town speaker.

- This was done to get leverage of the town’s resources.
- He is compassionate for the people.

- The knight serve the arch-devil levistus
- The knights say The dueguar are planing to overthrow tentoesn.
