RADIA AND SHYVET
Radia is the energy that flows through all living beings, born from the natural processes of life. It is the energy that allows a being to evolve themsevers into something comepletley new and gain power beyond the the imagining of a mortal.

 All radiance originates from a single source— the sun, or more concretely, the enegry that emanates from it: *Shyvet*.  Raining down from the sky, Shyvet is then collected by the pants, consumed through the food chain or even absorbed into the skin directly. One in the body of a living organixim, it is then broken down and made anew into Radia. Shyvet of course is what allows living organisms to function at all, as it creates energy that is much needed for our survival.

As this Shyvet breaks down in our bodies, the Radia is produced as a byproduct. Due to its properties, Radia naturally seeks areas with low Radia, trying to spread itself equally. This coats the entire world with its influence, allowing the non living to breathed life into with its mysterious ways.

RADIANCE AND THE RADIANTS
Radia naturally flows out of living beings without much impact. It is impossible to sense with the untrained body, meaning that most beings are not even aware of its existence. However, there is a way to prevent this leak of energy and even go as far as to reverse the flow in a process known as Radiantization, a mouthful i know.  Yadast





 
 
This technique allows one to strengthen their body, develop abilities, and even offers a path toward ascension to deity status. As one becomes more radiant, their body generates less radia, instead becoming a consumer of it, needing to draw in radia from the environment to function.


Once you start absorbing Radia, you become a Radiant— a Being powered by Radia instead of a creator of one.  

All current gods ascended in this way—once insignificant beings who learned how to accumulate radiance until they rose above the creators of radia to become direct consumers on a massive scale. But the subject of deities is a discussion for another time.

Radia is produced by the cells of living organisms, but it quickly diffuses out of the body. It naturally seeks to spread to areas with lower energy, distributing itself evenly. However, in the brief window before the radia leaves the body, an organism can control it. With the right knowledge, practice, or intuition, one can learn to capture this fleeting energy, attaching it to the liquid in the body—usually blood, though it could be water for beings without blood. Over time, this energy can calcify within the body’s tissues, allowing the being to build up radia that can be harnessed for magic and radiant abilities.

A key benefit of this process is that it creates a larger "Lumikost" for your radiance. The radia bound to your flesh acts like a reservoir—though it cannot be directly used, it mimics the state of a non-living object, allowing your capacity for radia to grow. This means radia will flow into this Lumikost if it’s not at full capacity, as it mimics an area of low radia. That’s why being near a powerful being can be exhausting—just their presence siphons energy from the environment. In the case of gods, this can be lethal, as they siphon so much radia that they can tear it from other living beings with devastating force.

Once this radiant Lumikost is established and a sufficient amount of radia is stored, it becomes usable power. There are two main practices for harnessing radiance: magic and *istota*.

**Magic** is the most common use of radia. It involves using external formulas to command radia and create various phenomena. It’s typically used for enchantments and magical items, which can be infused with radia to produce predictable effects. However, magic is inherently limited and extremely difficult to master, as it requires a deep understanding of multiple fields—science, mathematics, and more. This is why magic is often the domain of academics and number-obsessed individuals like me.

The second practice is the *istota*, which is crucial for ascending to godhood. The *istota* allows beings to exert powers beyond the reach of normal creatures—without relying on formulas, knowledge, or coaxing, but through sheer force of will. The *istota* forms when calcified radia builds up to such a point that it can be controlled, both within and outside the body. Calcified radia takes on the appearance of metallic liquid, which can be absorbed or expelled from the skin at will. This liquid can be shaped into weapons, and at this stage, an ability will emerge from it. Typically, a suitable mark will also appear on the user’s body, matching the ability. Abilities tend to reflect the nature of the living being, as that’s the easiest form for radia to replicate, and they usually fall into one of five categories: fungi, plant, animal, protist, or monera. As the *istota* grows stronger, it can even begin to alter the user’s body, allowing them to enter an ascended state with vastly increased power.

When a creature that holds radia dies, its radia—and its *istota*, if it had one—melts back into the earth, making the land where they fall incredibly fertile.

It’s important to note that, because of Jarilo’s Curse, only humans in the current age can produce an *istota*. This has led to humans being oppressed and feared, as they are the only intelligent species left with the potential to become powerful enough to ascend to deity status. While non-humans—beasts and plants—can still occasionally gain an *istota*, such cases are exceedingly rare and nearly impossible to reproduce reliably.

Other humanoids have learned to partially harness the *istota* for themselves, though it remains a rare occurrence. This is often achieved by consuming radia, but it’s a dangerous process. Overuse of radia can exhaust a being, burning through their blood supply, and excessive use can be fatal as it drains the body’s liquids completely.
