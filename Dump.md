Musings of a Scholar:

  

Word from the author.

This collection of world knowledge is a personal endeavor, born out of my own curiosity and intended for those who share my interests. It also serves as a guide for new humans adapting to this world. While I aspire to publish this encyclopedia, its pro-human stance may face significant censorship in the editorial process, given my human perspective.

As for my credentials as an author of this encyclopedia, I am a well-studied scholar with millennia of experience walking this planet. I have witnessed and documented many of the events I write about, and my information is robust and thorough. Additionally, I am Jarilo's chosen, but that tale is for another time. I am also the founder of the Ministry of Knowledge. If you, the reader, come across this book and are not affiliated with the Ministry, consider this an invitation to join us, as your interest in knowledge is evident by reading these pages.

  

  

About the world of Rodynia

Rodinya is what the current sentient spiececs call home.

About the gods

Gods, as surprising it was to a previously aethiest human like myself, were always among us. 

  

  

  

  

Gods, as suprising it could have been to a previously simple human like myself where always among us. it impossible to know the full history of what happened in the godly relms but we do now facts that lay coloser to our worlds inception. there was once many dieties but at our worlds creatrion there was only 4 left- and juding as what happened later on with them, the reason the number decreased was because these beings were petty and malicous in nature and did not mind tearing apart one of their own and did their best to kick down anyone who would try to reach god hood. they attempted that with me too, though i was not an easy person who deal with. thanlfully i hid myself extremely well, its not like i want to engage with them anyway.

</aside>

There were four deities and each of them created their own worlds, Jarilo, Morana, Stribog and Mokosh. They were called the…

jarilo

Jarilo was the god of rebirth and nature, and he created what we now consider humans. His creation, more than any of the 4 where the closest in thr image of the gods. The humans were the most… in control out of all the races. They had hints of greed, wrath and lust… but they weren’t defined by these traits. They were the most perfect a mortal race could get- they weren’t by any means perfect but at least the parents did not canibalize their childern on a whim like mornings creations, and they at least had inventiveness and cunningness unlike god 3’s creatures. What they had different from the other creaturetes was that Jarilo never cared to make his creations strong…. He wanted his creations to make art and flourish

  

He lived in a perpetual cycle of rebirth, wilting with the winter and rising with the spring. Though for a deity like himself, death was more of a sleep than a passing.

Jarilo’s work sadly earned the ire of the other gods. They could never match the work of jaralio. Their worlds were all ash and rock and their creations all savage, mindless beings. In their jealousy for once the gods made a truce: to steal the fruits of jarilos labor. They collapsed their creations on one another, merging all 4 worlds into one plane. each of the gods also captured the humans and merged those creations into thier own. howver, even when they stole everything from jarilo, it was not enough. they knew that they could not match jrilos work so they decided to destory him.

they tore him apart and fed his flesh to their creations. little did they know that in his dying breaths, jarilo lauged and let out a curse into his fesh. everone who ate it became dammed, unable to use magic anymore. even the goods who participated in this ritual were severly impacted, their powers were impacted. the gods, finishing their feast of his flesh used his blood to fertellize the land, making thier barren world floorish with jarilos flora. the plants became posion for all those who were not made enterly by him, making all who are not human mutate wi

About the races

Gizkia: Humans of the old age.

  

Humans(referred in this age as Gizkia’s), although vastly flawed, are the most successful attempt at creating sentient life any god, old or new, has been able to create. And I am not saying this from the biased perspective of a human: I'm saying this from my perspective as a well studied Scholar. While the gods are extremely powerful beings, they are not to the extent they are worshiped to. Creating life in fact is something they find quite a bit of difficulty, and something every god in documented history has been unable to perfect. This is not to say that humans are this perfect creation, as stated before, but comparatively to other living life, they might as well be.

  

They possessed the following traits that made them so successful: Innovation, curiosity, self discipline, and most importantly, empathy. This was because Jarilo ultimately wanted his creations to live without his constant interference as he did not believe in forcing his creations to worship him. The beautiful earth I remember had been his billion year long project into making a self governing society, tinkering with his creations bit by bit until he finally created the modern humans who were capable of creating a society on their own. Jarilo prioritize his creations choice to self covent to the point that he did not even mind humans worhiping whatever deity they made up, instead being proud his his creating for being able to think of such things in the first place.

  

Another part of the human, and probably all his creations on earth, was their short lifespan and lack of divinity. Short livespans allowed for(reliively) quick iterations on the make up of his creations, allowing him to tinker on his designs to his hearts desire. Another part of a human that contributed to their success is the lack of divinity. jarlio unuquy did not gift his children with any divine powers, making them weak fleshy creatures that perished after a mere hundred years, but somehow that allowed them to not only have a different approach to life than the other raced but also seek answers to questions in other disciples other than the divine. The only thing that they possessed was wit and perseverance which lead them down the path i am going down now: the path of knowledge. They aimed to first and foremost understand and harness their surrownings instead of reling on unexplained powers, allowing science and technology even the gods could not convice of. Hell, at the height of the human civilization, the humans probably amassed enough knowledge to be comparable to gods. Some even started their journey on creating new, artificial life, something that was supposed to be the past time of dieties.

  

Sadly, as that old human legend of icarus, their successes ended up with their destruction. The gods became jelaous and even afraid of these creations rising to godhood, instead choosing to destroy the and do their best to have them for themselves. Of course, the rest is history.

  

The original Humans, or rather the Gizakia, however are now extinct due to the events of the Jainkoen Jaia. Instead, their legacy live on i the new humans: Novgizkia:

  

  

Novgizakia: the humans of the new age.

  

In an attempt to save his creations from the greed of the other gods, Jarlio blessed his children with his divine powers and placed all of them under his protection while he recovered his strength. This protection was done by encasing them in a cocoon-like membrane and burying them underground, where they would be placed into hibernation until the surface was safe again.

  

However, Jarlio never ended up recovering his strength- and the humans never were freed from their sleep. He lost against the other gods, leaving the blessed humans, buried in cocoons all around the globe. Eons later, after civilizations rose and fell, the cocoons still preserved whoever lies inside. However, over time, the caccons have lost their protective properties, allowing them to be easily opened, waking any unfortunate Humans inside into a new age beyond their comprehension. To say it was a shocking awakening was a massive understatement… most who waken do not realize that they never left earth… Some deny it even after learning the truth, refusing to acknowledge their reality as they remain stagnant, idolizing the past.

  

While the Majority of Human awakenings have been documented to have happened in the last 100 years or so, there has been many cases where individuals have emerged from their cocoons eons before the protective divinity started to wane, most likely due to their own strong divine power or outside interference.

  

Those who are astute must have noticed that I happen to be a quite ancient individual myself. I've watched countries fall and rise, yet my skin lacks a single wrinkle as the current human no longer experiences aging, at least not in the same way old humans did. This is because of Jarlio's blessing. After all, he was a god of rebirth and life; his blessing allowed Humans to practically live forever.

  

The blessing of Jarlio also gave humans the ability to defend themselves with means other than their ingenuity. He gave them the gift of Divinity: the manifestation of their own soul into a weapon with divine abilities. The Istota is a quite elaborate topic, so I will dedicate a section below to explore the topic at length.

While we inherited that strength from him, we also inherited his crippling weakness: the inability to bear winter cold. Because for all the power Jarlio had, in the end, he withered in the snow, dying like any run of the mill mortal. But, unlike Jarilo, we as humans cannot simply be reborn once spring comes around, making the cold both a danger for those who still want to live and salvation for those who want to die. Ice and freezing temperatures are the only things that currently curb human resilience. In fact, the current method the local species have of disposing of us humans is to freeze and shatter us, burying our remains deep underground.

  

Aside from the divine gifts from Jarlio, new Humans also differ in appearance and biological make up from the old humans. One crucial difference is their eyes. The eye colors of the new humans tend to encompass every color under the sun. For example, if the human individual possesses a daisy based istota, their eyes would betray this in the way their eyes are colored or pupils are shaped.  Hair color also tends to be rather wild for the individuals of our species. More uncommon, yet still not too rare features also tend to be claws and fangs, these features emerging most probably due to a more aggressive mutation from being suddenly injected with vast amounts of divine power. What makes me think that this is a mutation rather than a racial feature is that these features emerge mostly in first generation of Humans, the ones who were Old humans in the past. The children of the first generation Humans tend to have less aggressive features, with them looking closer to their human ancestors.This makes it obvious easy for the ones in the know to pick out individuals have lived before the Death of Jarilo. First-generation Human tend to have an incredibly high value in this new age as they have stronger abilities than later generation Humans. As such, they tend to be very valued in the slave trade and also in creating Independent Istotas (more on that in the Istota section).There is also a market that harvests Humans for consumption where the first generations individuals fetch quite a price is, as it is the common belief among the local species that consuming human parts will increase  their longevity and have rejuvenating properties.

  

  

  

  

Other than these outward variations, there are some biological differences between the two races too. For one, these new humans have 40 teeth instead of the usual 32. I could not find a reason for this in all my research. However, interestingly enough, these extra teeth do not lead to any complications. They don't even have issues with wisdom teeth! Even I, the great scholar, had mine removed when I was a normal human, so I know full well what sort of issues that can arise. Maybe the fact that humans have regenerative abilities is helping them not encounter that problem? It's a small thing, but it perplexes me greatly. The sizes of organs differ too, with lungs being significantly larger in the new humans than their counterparts, making them have higher stamina recovery. The new humans also naturally have stronger bodies than their counterparts, with their skin being quite a bit thicker, Though of course, this hardness is not significant. Humans also require much less food to stay alive—in fact, some do not need to eat at all. I once encountered an individual who did not eat for 3 years as she was locked in someone's basement and completely forgotten about. She was as skinny as a skeleton but still lived despite this circumstance, being able to recover quite fast with just a bit of proper feeding.

  

A very key feature of these humans, and also why the cold is so crippling to them, is because despite being warm-blooded originally, Novgizkias are cold-blooded. They cannot generate their own heat, so it is imperative that they can retain or have some sort of heating mechanism on them; otherwise, their movement will be completely reduced if not halted. Cold also makes them tired, with hibernation being common in these humans as they can sleep for very extended amounts of time.

  

Humans are also the only creatures immune to Jarlio's breath, in fact, being able to spread it as they plant Jarlio's curse on whoever they kill with their Istota. This makes them able to live in the world's vast forests where the rest of the races would find inhospitable.

  

Humans in the current political climate are not doing well. They are hunted into slavery in any well-off cities, and in the lower towns, they remain as 3rd or 4th or, dare I say, 5th class citizens—the local races detest them. How could they not? Humans are blessed with awesome magic by the very same god that cursed them into being like flightless birds when it comes to divine magic: classified as highly magical creatures that cannot create a single divine fluctuation. The abilities of the Istotas also pose a heavy danger to the local residents, making them come to the conclusion that controlling and excluding humans is the best way to protect their safety and egos.

  

There are a couple of different organizations with humans around the world, both human-led and locally led. The locally led organizations tend to use humans as weapons or free labor. Meanwhile, the human-run ones either focus on independent survival or do their best to blend in with the locals and forget their human roots. The most prolific of those organizations is the Assimilation Society, and they reject their humanness to the point that they don masks and clothing to resemble the locals as well as rejecting their divine powers. To be honest, I do not have a good history with the Assimilation Society, and I generally do not like their modus operandi. They, after all, look for Novgizkia cocoons and force them open, basically kidnapping the individuals inside and forcing them them to join their cause. A couple novice scholars under my wing have been awakened into this age by the Assimilaion society, having their will broken by them before being captured and sold into slavery where i managed to pick them up before a local managed to.

Istotas

  

Dragons, to my knowledge, are one of the most powerful races in the world, even stronger than the angels if we're talking about higher orders. They are created by the god of wrath Lytta and although i wouldn't say they fully believe in her like a god, they respect her like their elder and follow some of her wishes. They are quite a curious race, one of the few that consume inorganic matter for sustenance, eating both gems and metals in extremely large quantities. They can eat organic matter too however they don't enjoy it very much. To be able to absorb the nutrients from their gems, their insides, especially their stomachs are like furnaces, melting their food with ease. The higher orders' insides are so hot that they can harness the heat and shoot out stremes of fire, and no normal fire either, it's one that can even melt stone. I've even had the pleasure of experiencing it myself, I was interviewing this gold dragon called Aurum and he burped fire by mistake, accidentally burning half my body which almost killed me...haha…

  

They are a race with extremely strong bodies from birth, their skin harnessing the strength of things they consume, with dragons consuming harder and stronger materials being more powerful. One of the things I've observed was that dragons that consume gems tend to be more powerful than the ones that consume metals so it is very important what a dragon eats from birth. I remember talking to a dragon named indicolite, she was laughing at a golden dragon (the one that almost killed be a few months prior) for being stupid for when he was younger as he robbed castle upon castle of thier treasures for gold and still eded up being weaker than her that just camped down in a mine. When I later mentioned a copper dragon that I once met, Indicolite showed strong destain for it and was saying it was probably incredibly weak… other dragons showed similar reactions, as a rule of thub, dragons with more power teded to be harsher with their discrimination and tedned to loathe things weaker than them more.

  

From that I could assume, there is not a lot of comradery between them, so it's somewhat amazing that these creatures that have no hesitation to turn against each other decided to form a nation. I suppose it's mostly to trade gems and metals smoothly with one another, at least that's what I surmised as it definitely wasn't for protection. Most absolutely didn't need it and the ones that did... their fellow dragons did not care about. Ahh, wait, the dragon lord could also be a reason they formed a nation. Apparently, it was the parent of most of the higher order dragons alive today, and is one of the only creatures the dragons respect outside their god. All the dragons seem to take pleasure by just being close to it, serving it also was very enjoyable to them. 

  

Ah, but back to some of their biology, If we're talking only about the strength of bodies only, they would be the strongest race with no competition whatsoever. Sadly they seem incapable of martial art and even though they can perform magic most don’t and just rely on their abilities. And what I also found was that Although dragons have a quite infamous reputation for being absolutely unparalleled in both brain and brawn, most of the lower order dragons lacked intellect and wings and are even sometimes mistaken for weirdly shaped wyverns and hunted. Actually, a lot of dragon parts are sold with nowhere near their proper value because of this, and if you know how to recognize their differences you can make a lot of money really quickly… I myself have done it a couple of times. 

  

However the dragons which either are almost high order or are high order beings, are quite frightening, extremely so… the high order dragons- or elder dragons as they call themself are creatures that have shed organic flesh and turned themselves into a more perfect form-- into a type of gem or metal. Fun fact, because of this, their bodies are highly sought after by any competent smiths. They are large in size, way larger than their lower order counterparts and have a certain aura of majesty which compelles things weaker than them to lower themself in front of them.  As for their cores, from what I gather it seems are their hearts, with them being highly coveted for magical, medical and even military purposes. Actually Indicolite showed one to me from an elder that died long ago, and it was smaller than I thought it would Be. The beautiful black diamond core could fit in my palm which surprised me extremely, apparently it shrunk when the dragon died. And the power coming from it was immense… not only did the heat from it burn though the entirety my hand but the mana from it that diffusers into my skin left me vomiting blood for the next few minutes… apparently my reaction really entertained Indicolite as she even gifted me the black diamond core after our interview, I had to really quickly go to a smith to create a container for it so I don’t die hahaha.

  

@

  

I’ve met many dragons while completing my research, and met one with an aura of majesty that was really breathtaking. Everything seemed to bow in its wake, even the trees and the grass. Its name was Garnet and we had I think the most interesting interviews I ever had. Although it looked down on most things almost religiously, It seemed to like the games of other races, collecting games from different continents and playing against random people it kidnapped. Ah, yes, I got kidnapped so the interview with Garnet wasn't exactly planned haha. Along with the majesty of the dragon that made me want to bow constantly and the fact that if i lost the game of chess it prepared i would die under its breath... i would say that i was lucky to get out alive. And even after i won i nearly died, its laughing voice in its full form was so oppressive that i nearly croaked on the spot. Ah about the mention of its full form, the elder dragons seem to be able to polymorph themselves into smaller forms, some of them even turning somewhat humanoid. Most dragons don't like to polymorph though as they were much weaker in that form. Garnet itself has a very human-like appearance in its polymorphed form, according to it, it was incredibly useful as being large can be problematic. It lamented that it killed its children way too many times by accidently stepping on them… which made my mouth twitch.

  

Dragons don't seem to have gender either, reproducing asssexualy by taking off their scales, swallowing them, tempering them in their forge like stomach and then spitting out their children. When Garnet told me this and even showed me a live demonstration of the steps taken, I was quite disturbed. It took quite a while to recover from that… for a long time whenever I looked at the dragons, all I could think about was how they're constantly covered with dormant babies… I couldn't even look at my once favorite dragon scale coat anymore! 

  

With… you can't really call it reproduction… multiplication like that, it's not surprising that dragons don't really have a bond with each other and have no kin-ship, especially considering that they can factory produce lower order dragons as long as they have scales. That's probably one of the reasons one dragon can be thought to be so fearsome I suppose, having a potential army on their body that they can vomit out whenever it’s convenient. Ah, And yes, in theory you can make your own DIY dragon factory if you have a really strong forge and some scales, i forgot which one but some country was using this method to produce an insane amount of dragon knights for their military. Also Because they multiply like this, they have no reproductive organs and no genders, though some choose to pick out some if they feel like it. Indicolite for example likes to make her polymorph more feminie and refer to herself as a girl while garnet chose to be genderless and has a assexual apearance.

  

One last thing, their naming system works according to their transformations. That is to say, lower order dragons mostly did not have names, sometimes they would choose one but most were not intelligent enough to do so. Elder Dragons meanwhile would name themselves after the ore they became, so aurum(apparently this was gold in an ancient language) was a gold dragon and Garnet was a garnet dragon. Ah, and the ore they transformed into was the type they consumed most before they matured into higher orders.

  

Hmm, for now I will try to meet the dragon lord, it is one of the dragons I'm most interested in, I cannot even imagine what ore it's made out of…. But… it's really hard to meet it though, all the dragons are super defensive about it and even if I do meet it, i might die. Second order dragons are already very oppressive, how would a dragon lord which is probably of first order be any less fearsome? I hope its presence is not strong enough to kill me on the spot haha.

  

  

  

  

the way magic works in rodinya is by means that were ment to serve to the benefit of humanity, yet ulimetly where one of the core reason why humans have earnes the ire of the residents of this land. 

  

Magic is executed through 3 main components

A liquid base fuel - a conditional - a amalgum - 

  

  

  

Liquid base

To power ones Istota, one needs to provide it with a souce of energy otherwise it will be nothing more than a simple metalic weapon. it laymans terms, it requires a fuel sorce. and this souce comes from only a single place on earth - the human body. more spesifically, what powers the istota is human blood. if the divine power in the istota activates, it will burn though all the liquid it has absorbed inside it, and once it is done, its power cannot be acticated unless more liquid has been absorbed. for humans, it is very easy to power their istota, howerver for rodinyas residents who can only accoure their istota of a fresh carrion of a human being, fueling it becomes quite the hastle.

  

first obstacle in fueling the istota is that, under normal curcumstances, the istota will only be fueled by the blood of their owner and 

  

  

  

  

conditionall.

  

  

  

  

istota

  

once you melt and fuse eneough istotas together, they become an amalgam. these amalgams do not have any commandments on them, meaning that one can inscribe whatever they wish as long as it does not exeed the capacity of the istoa. sadly amalgums have a much lower capacity that full istotas. amalgams are usualy used for more mundane and everyday items for the rich. though, with alot of layered conditonals ans many many amalgams, one can create some fightening
