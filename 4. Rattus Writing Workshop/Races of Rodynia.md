Gizkia: Humans of the old age.

  

Humans(referred in this age as Gizkia’s), although vastly flawed, are the most successful attempt at creating sentient life any god, old or new, has been able to create. And I am not saying this from the biased perspective of a human: I'm saying this from my perspective as a well studied Scholar. While the gods are extremely powerful beings, they are not to the extent they are worshiped to. Creating life in fact is something they find quite a bit of difficulty, and something every god in documented history has been unable to perfect. This is not to say that humans are this perfect creation, as stated before, but comparatively to other living life, they might as well be.

  

They possessed the following traits that made them so successful: Innovation, curiosity, self discipline, and most importantly, empathy. This was because Jarilo ultimately wanted his creations to live without his constant interference as he did not believe in forcing his creations to worship him. The beautiful earth I remember had been his billion year long project into making a self governing society, tinkering with his creations bit by bit until he finally created the modern humans who were capable of creating a society on their own. Jarilo prioritize his creations choice to self covent to the point that he did not even mind humans worhiping whatever deity they made up, instead being proud his his creating for being able to think of such things in the first place.

  

Another part of the human, and probably all his creations on earth, was their short lifespan and lack of divinity. Short livespans allowed for(reliively) quick iterations on the make up of his creations, allowing him to tinker on his designs to his hearts desire. Another part of a human that contributed to their success is the lack of divinity. jarlio unuquy did not gift his children with any divine powers, making them weak fleshy creatures that perished after a mere hundred years, but somehow that allowed them to not only have a different approach to life than the other raced but also seek answers to questions in other disciples other than the divine. The only thing that they possessed was wit and perseverance which lead them down the path i am going down now: the path of knowledge. They aimed to first and foremost understand and harness their surrownings instead of reling on unexplained powers, allowing science and technology even the gods could not convice of. Hell, at the height of the human civilization, the humans probably amassed enough knowledge to be comparable to gods. Some even started their journey on creating new, artificial life, something that was supposed to be the past time of dieties.

  

Sadly, as that old human legend of icarus, their successes ended up with their destruction. The gods became jelaous and even afraid of these creations rising to godhood, instead choosing to destroy the and do their best to have them for themselves. Of course, the rest is history.

  

The original Humans, or rather the Gizakia, however are now extinct due to the events of the Jainkoen Jaia. Instead, their legacy live on i the new humans: Novgizkia:

  

  

Novgizakia: the humans of the new age.

  

In an attempt to save his creations from the greed of the other gods during the Jainkoen Jaia, Jarlio blessed his children with his divine powers and placed all of them under his protection while he recovered his strength. This protection was done by encasing them in a cocoon-like membrane and burying them underground, where they would be placed into hibernation until the surface was safe again.

  

However, Jarlio never ended up recovering his strength- and the humans never were freed from their sleep. He lost against the other gods, leaving the blessed humans, the Novgizakias, buried in cocoons all around the globe. Eons later, after civilizations rose and fell, the cocoons still preserved whoever lies inside. However, over time, the caccons have lost their protective properties, allowing them to be easily opened, waking any unfortunate Novgizkia inside into a new age beyond their comprehension. To say it was a shocking awakening was a massive understatementâ€¦ most who waken do not realize that they never left earthâ€¦ Some deny it even after learning the truth, refusing to acknowledge their reality as they remain stagnant, idolizing the past.

  

While the Majority of Novgizakia awakening have been documented to have happened in the last century, there has been many cases where individuals have emerged from their cocoons eons before the protective divinity started to wane, most likely due to their own strong divine power or outside interference.

  

Those who are astute must have noticed that I happen to be a quite ancient individual myself. I've watched countries fall and rise, yet my skin lacks a single wrinkle as the current human no longer experiences aging. This is because of Jarlio's blessing. After all, he was a god of rebirth and life; his blessing allowed Novgizakias to practically live forever.

  

The blessing of Jarlio also gave humans the ability to defend themselves with means other than their ingenuity. He gave them the gift of Istotas: the manifestation of their own soul into a weapon with divine abilities. The Istota is a quite elaborate topic, so I will dedicate a section below to explore the topic at length.

While we inherited that strength from him, we also inherited his crippling weakness: the inability to bear winter cold. Because for all the power Jarlio had, in the end, he withered in the snow, dying like any run of the mill mortal. But, unlike Jarilo, we as humans cannot simply be reborn once spring comes around, making the cold both a danger for those who still want to live and salvation for those who want to die. Ice and freezing temperatures are the only things that currently curb human resilience. In fact, the current method the local species have of disposing of us humans is to freeze and shatter us, burying our remains deep underground.

  

Aside from the divine gifts from Jarlio, the Novgizka also differ in appearance and biological make up from the Gizka. One crucial difference is their eyes. The eye colors of the new humans tend to encompass every color under the sun, and this color often reflects the essence of their istota. For example, if the human individual possesses a daisy based istota, their eyes would betray this in the way their eyes are colored or pupils are shaped.  Hair color also tends to be rather wild for the individuals of our species. More uncommon, yet still not too rare features also tend to be claws and fangs, these features emerging most probably due to a more aggressive mutation from being suddenly injected with vast amounts of divine power. What makes me think that this is a mutation rather than a racial feature is that these features emerge mostly in first generation Novgizkia’s, the ones who were Gizkia’s in the past. The children of the first generation novgizikas tend to have less aggressive features, with them looking closer to their human ancestors.This makes it obvious easy for the ones in the know to pick out individuals have lived before the Jainkoen Jaia, but thankfully this is not very common knowledge else all the first generation individuals would have been hunted like dogs. First-generation Novgizkia tend to have an incredibly high value in this new age as they have stronger abilities than later generation Novgizkia. As such, they tend to be very valued in the slave trade and also in creating Independent Istotas (more on that in the Istota section).There is also a market that harvests Novgizkias for consumption where the first generations individuals fetch quite a price is, as it is the common belief among the local species that consuming human parts will increase  their longevity and have rejuvenating properties.

  

  

  

  

Other than these outward variations, there are some biological differences between the two races too. For one, these new humans have 40 teeth instead of the usual 32. I could not find a reason for this in all my research. However, interestingly enough, these extra teeth do not lead to any complications. They don't even have issues with wisdom teeth! Even I, the great scholar, had mine removed when I was a normal human, so I know full well what sort of issues that can arise. Maybe the fact that humans have regenerative abilities is helping them not encounter that problem? It's a small thing, but it perplexes me greatly. The sizes of organs differ too, with lungs being significantly larger in the new humans than their counterparts, making them have higher stamina recovery. The new humans also naturally have stronger bodies than their counterparts, with their skin being quite a bit thicker, acting as natural armor. Though of course, this hardness is not significant. Novgizkia also require much less food to stay aliveâ€”in fact, they do not need to eat at all, though of course, that is not recommended. I once encountered an individual who did not eat for 3 years as she was locked in someone's basement and completely forgotten about. She was as skinny as a skeleton but still lived despite this circumstance, being able to recover quite fast with just a bit of proper feeding.

  

A very key feature of these humans, and also why the cold is so crippling to them, is because despite being warm-blooded originally, Novgizkias are cold-blooded. They cannot generate their own heat, so it is imperative that they can retain or have some sort of heating mechanism on them; otherwise, their movement will be completely reduced if not halted. Cold also makes them tired, with hibernation being common in these humans as they can sleep for very extended amounts of time.

  

Humans are also the only creatures immune to Jarlio's breath, in fact, being able to spread it as they plant Jarlio's curse on whoever they kill with their Istota. This makes them able to live in the world's vast forests where the rest of the races would find inhospitable.

  

Humans in the current political climate are not doing well. They are hunted into slavery in any well-off cities, and in the lower towns, they remain as 3rd or 4th or, dare I say, 5th class citizensâ€”the local races detest them. How could they not? Humans are blessed with awesome magic by the very same god that cursed them into being like flightless birds when it comes to divine magic: classified as highly magical creatures that cannot create a single divine fluctuation. The abilities of the Istotas also pose a heavy danger to the local residents, making them come to the conclusion that controlling and excluding humans is the best way to protect their safety and egos.

  

There are a couple of different organizations with humans around the world, both human-led and locally led. The locally led organizations tend to use humans as weapons or free labor. Meanwhile, the human-run ones either focus on independent survival or do their best to blend in with the locals and forget their human roots. The most prolific of those organizations is the Assimilation Society, and they reject their humanness to the point that they don masks and clothing to resemble the locals as well as rejecting their divine powers. To be honest, I do not have a good history with the Assimilation Society, and I generally do not like their modus operandi. They, after all, look for Novgizkia cocoons and force them open, basically kidnapping the individuals inside and forcing them them to join their cause. A couple novice scholars under my wing have been awakened into this age by the Assimilaion society, having their will broken by them before being captured and sold into slavery where i managed to pick them up before a local managed to.
