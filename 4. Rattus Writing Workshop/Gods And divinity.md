Gods, as suprising it could have been to a previously simple human like myself where always among us. it impossible to know the full history of what happened in the godly relms but we do now facts that lay coloser to our worlds inception. there was once many dieties but at our worlds creatrion there was only 4 left- and juding as what happened later on with them, the reason the number decreased was because these beings were petty and malicous in nature and did not mind tearing apart one of their own and did their best to kick down anyone who would try to reach god hood. they attempted that with me too, though i was not an easy person who deal with. thanlfully i hid myself extremely well, its not like i want to engage with them anyway.


There were four deities and each of them created their own worlds, Jarilo, Morana, Stribog and Mokosh. They were called theâ€¦

jarilo

Jarilo was the god of rebirth and nature, and he created what we now consider humans. His creation, more than any of the 4 where the closest in thr image of the gods. The humans were the mostâ€¦ in control out of all the races. They had hints of greed, wrath and lustâ€¦ but they weren’t defined by these traits. They were the most perfect a mortal race could get- they weren’t by any means perfect but at least the parents did not canibalize their childern on a whim like mornings creations, and they at least had inventiveness and cunningness unlike god 3’s creatures. What they had different from the other creaturetes was that Jarilo never cared to make his creations strongâ€¦. He wanted his creations to make art and flourish

  

He lived in a perpetual cycle of rebirth, wilting with the winter and rising with the spring. Though for a deity like himself, death was more of a sleep than a passing.

Jarilo’s work sadly earned the ire of the other gods. They could never match the work of jaralio. Their worlds were all ash and rock and their creations all savage, mindless beings. In their jealousy for once the gods made a truce: to steal the fruits of jarilos labor. They collapsed their creations on one another, merging all 4 worlds into one plane. each of the gods also captured the humans and merged those creations into thier own. howver, even when they stole everything from jarilo, it was not enough. they knew that they could not match jrilos work so they decided to destory him.

they tore him apart and fed his flesh to their creations. little did they know that in his dying breaths, jarilo lauged and let out a curse into his fesh. everone who ate it became dammed, unable to use magic anymore. even the goods who participated in this ritual were severly impacted, their powers were impacted. the gods, finishing their feast of his flesh used his blood to fertellize the land, making thier barren world floorish with jarilos flora. the plants became posion for all those who were not made enterly by him, making all who are not human mutate wi
