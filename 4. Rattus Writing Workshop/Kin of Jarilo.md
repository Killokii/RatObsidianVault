This collection of world knowledge is a personal endeavor, born out of my own curiosity and intended for those who share my interests. It also serves as a guide for new humans adapting to this world. While I aspire to publish this encyclopedia, its pro-human stance may face significant censorship in the editorial process, given my human perspective.

As for my credentials as an author of this encyclopedia, I am a well-studied scholar with millennia of experience walking this planet. I have witnessed and documented many of the events I write about, and my information is robust and thorough. Additionally, I am Jarilo's chosen, but that tale is for another time. I am also the founder of the Ministry of Knowledge. If you, the reader, come across this book and are not affiliated with the Ministry, consider this an invitation to join us, as your interest in knowledge is evident by reading these pages.
