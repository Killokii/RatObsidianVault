Made our way to the lost spire of the nether isle city
It was burried undergound
It was probably here since the fall of netheril
When we where arriving we bumped into [[Avarice]] who was told this location by [[Disious]]
- she agreed to split the loot 50/50
- we began exploring the lost spire that was an absolute mess, work stations were a mess and the majority was unscavangable
- We got some loot: a portion of resistence
- We found some books dating back to the nether in empire
- Some of this books include magical wonders of netheril: this includes ancient elven magic
- Another book: mysteries of the pherun: they mind controlled mind flayers
- book of the hollow: how the netherize empire came to be
- ajimars guide to the fantastic: Illusion magic
- The untethered mind: this book was written by a lunatic and discusses how one might be suspended in a brain outside of their body
- As we were leaving we encountered two people:
	- Simulacrum of Dazan: red wizard of thay: meaning he is still alize
		-his body guard named krintas, who guards his simulacrum
