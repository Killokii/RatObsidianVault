- low frame rate :(
- need to fix the seam between terrain and cliffs
- Vfx on the dash charges need to be done
- More obstacles
- Horns should blend with the terrain more
- Drums needs to be collet matched more
- Make goats die via crit
- Grass needs to be placed more appropriately
- Gate vfx needs to be updated
- Potentially redo the wind as it does not seem to all match up.
- Have some wind vfx
- Texture instruments
- More atmosphere sounds, leaves rustling, bells? Animal cries > some stuff to have it be more grounded.
- Fix lighting? Potentially move to volumetric?? A for would help a lot.
- More environmental storytelling in levels right now there is a lack of interesting set pieces.
- Give more of a incentive to charge, right now bora has not used the charge once.
- Volume sliders lmao…
- Optimize it more > life’s and such.
- Fix jump, does not feel right rn, requires animation
- Fill the environment with props.
- More hazards.
- Bora was confused where to go on the winding bit of the level.
- Have a more clear path to follow, currently although the path exists, it is still hard to navigate with
- It’s not clear that the players need to go to the sound gates. What can we do to change it?? Idk to be completely honest.
- Bomb guys such ass, we have not taught the player in any way how to interact with them
- <u>TUTORIAL IS NEEDED SOOOO MUCH OMG</u>
- Gate in the mines is fucked
- big orb does not work with our game.
- Make the level a couple loops spilt apart.
- Trap enemies in a loop.



Oeifhew



Meeting notes
- paths need to be more clear > potentially use like an Elden ring grace shader.
- There is a log area you can get stuck in a loop but we need to make this loop intentally
