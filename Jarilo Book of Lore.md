### how territory is split
There is land that belongs to monarchs and there is land that belongs to gods

Lands that belongs to monarchs are ruled by mortal mortals without a deity residing in their land. People in such countries typically have large religious freedom.

Land that belongs to the gods are typically small territories that have their own governance. They can be in the middle of countries and but they will be counted as indipendent sates. These areas are where gods reside. Gods like to stay in a single area as they get the most power being near the hearts of their temples. Gods true bodies is essentially a building with a heart.
