Hi Alan,
Nice to E-meet you as well~! Thank you for responding and delivering the very exciting news! Sorry for the late response but I realized I don’t have a general folio, so I spend today putting it together to make my work a bit more accessible hehe.

Here are the answers to the questions you have provided:


1. My reason for applying is that I want to expand my skill set in animation and 3d workflows, learn more about professional working habits and learn from people in the industry. Of course, also to break into the industry as a game dev! As for the second half of the question, I am indeed an avid gamer! I’m a huge fan of the Horror, RPG, and turn-based combat genres, among many more. My favorite games are Outer Wilds/pathologic 2/disco Elysium/Baldur’s gate 3, and right now my current obsession is Honkai Star Rail :)))

2. I am unsure about the salary expectation's of this role, as I do not know the market, especially since this is my first time applying for this role. 

3. Currently doing freelance commission work, so I do not need a notice period.

4. I am currently a permanent resident! 

5. I will be gone over Christmas until mid-January, but I can start work right away after I return.

6. Hybrid work is perfect for me! :)

7. I do not have any showcase reel, but here are the links to my folios~

8. During my studies, I learned how to use Maya for modeling, rigging, and animation before moving to Blender a year ago, which I am now quite proficient with.

9. My experience with keyframe animation mostly consists of the uni projects I have done during my studies. 

10. I am located close to the CBD!

Thank you again for your reply! I look forward to hearing from you again soon,
