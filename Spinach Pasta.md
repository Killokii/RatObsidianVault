This is just a recipe I found on Instagram that turned out quite well. It is very easy to make too!

You will need the following:
- bag of spinach, can be stale
- 1 1/2 cups of flour
- One egg

The recipe goes as follows:
1. Blend the egg and spinach together into a paste.
2. Add in flour and knead for a few minutes
3. Cover the dough and let it rest for at least 30 minutes
4. Once you are ready to cook, cut the dough with scissors and boil until it rises to the top.
